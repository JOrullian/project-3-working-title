## 1. Description

Shift is a application that allows users to connect and share skills with each other. A user may create a posting for each skill that they can offer, whether it's teaching someone how to cook sushi, or walking someone's dogs, or anything else. User's are able to search Shift's database for any skill they require and can connect other users that can provide that skill.

There are many skill sharing applications on the market, but all of them focus on one side providing a skill and the other providing monetary compensation. This app does not restrict clients from using money as the only form of compensation. Users can hash out a skill for skill trade, offer free services, or still allow users to opt into third-party fund-sharing services if they so desire.

The goal of Shift is to improve connectivity between people and let the users step outside of mainstream goods-for-funds transactions.
